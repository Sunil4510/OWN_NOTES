1. Redux is used for state management.
2. The data in react always flows from parent   to child components which makes it unidirectional.
3. So data can't be send from childs to parents like bottom to top.
4. So hence data can be send from top to bottom (parent to child).
5. This problem is overcome by react introducing the new concept called Prop Drilling.
6. But Prop Drilling becomes a problem of passing the data from one component to another component.
7. for example if you want to pass a data to from component A to component C then you need to pass the data to all the components that are in between component A and component C.
8. Hence this is called prop drilling problem because everytime we are passing props.
9. So for this problem we have two solutions.
10. 1.Redux
    2. (useContext, contextAPI).
